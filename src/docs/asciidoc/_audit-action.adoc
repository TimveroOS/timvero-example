== User Action Audit

The User Action Audit system provides comprehensive tracking and logging of all user activities in the back-office application. This feature is essential for compliance, security monitoring, and troubleshooting user issues.

=== Overview

The audit system automatically captures:

* **HTTP Requests**: All HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
* **User Identity**: Which user performed each action
* **Network Information**: Client IP addresses
* **Request Details**: Full URL paths and query parameters
* **Timestamps**: Exact time of each action
* **Authentication Events**: Successful login attempts

All audit records are persisted to the database with asynchronous batch processing to ensure minimal performance impact on user requests.

=== Configuration

==== Enabling the Feature

Add the following property to your `application.properties`:

[source,properties]
