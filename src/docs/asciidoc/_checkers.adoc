This section describes how to set up and manage Entity Checkers for automated business rule validation and state management in the application.

== Checker System Architecture

The platform uses Entity Checkers to implement event-driven business logic that automatically responds to entity changes. Checkers serve as reactive components that monitor database changes and execute business rules when specific conditions are met.

=== What are Entity Checkers?

Entity Checkers are specialized components that:

* **Monitor Entity Changes**: Automatically detect when entities are created, updated, or deleted
* **Apply Business Rules**: Execute predefined logic when specific conditions are satisfied
* **Maintain Data Consistency**: Ensure related entities remain synchronized
* **Automate Workflows**: Trigger next steps in business processes without manual intervention

=== Checker Class Hierarchy

The application uses a structured checker architecture based on framework components:

* **Base Checker Classes**: Framework-provided abstract classes (`EntityChecker`) that handle the infrastructure
* **Custom Entity Checkers**: Application-specific implementations:
  - `BorrowerStartTreeChecker` - manages borrower workflow initiation

Each checker consists of three main parts:

* **<<listener-registration,Listener Registration>>** (`registerListeners` method) - defines what entity changes to monitor
* **Availability Check** (`isAvailable` method) - determines when the checker should execute
* **Business Logic** (`perform` method) - implements the actual business rule

== Listener Registration

The `registerListeners` method is the core mechanism for defining what entity changes a checker should monitor. This method uses the `CheckerListenerRegistry` to configure event listeners that will trigger the checker's business logic.

=== CheckerListenerRegistry

`CheckerListenerRegistry<E>` is a registry for configuring event listeners for entity changes. The generic type `E` represents the target entity type that the checker operates on (e.g., `Application`, `Participant`).

==== Key Methods

[cols="1,2,3", options="header"]
|===
|Method |Parameters |Description

|`entityChange`
|`Class<T> entityClass` - Type of entity being monitored +
`Function<T, E> mapper` - Function to convert changed entity to target entity
|Creates a listener for entity change events. See <<using-entitychange-method,usage examples>>.

|`entityChange`
|_(no parameters)_
|Monitors the same entity type as the checker (shorthand). See <<using-entitychange-method,usage examples>>.

|`updated`
|`String... fields` - Names of fields to monitor for changes
|Filters to field update events only.

|`inserted`
|_(no parameters)_
|Filters to entity insertion events only.

|`and`
|`Predicate<T> predicate` - Custom condition that must be satisfied
|Adds filtering conditions. Chain multiple conditions together.

==== Using entityChange Method

The `entityChange` method provides flexible entity-to-target mapping capabilities to solve different monitoring scenarios in checker implementations.

===== Direct Entity Monitoring

**Problem:** Your checker needs to monitor changes to the same entity type it operates on.

For example, an `ApplicationChecker` that monitors `Application` entity changes directly.

**Solution:**

[source,java]
----
registry.entityChange().updated("status")
----

This monitors changes to the same entity type as the checker operates on.

.When to Use
* Simple checkers where trigger entity = target entity
* Direct field monitoring without complex relationships
* Most straightforward monitoring scenario

===== Related Entity Monitoring

**Problem:** Your checker needs to monitor changes to different entity types and map them to the target entity through relationships.

For example, an `ApplicationChecker` that triggers when related `Participant` entities change, but needs to operate on the `Application`.

**Solution:**

[source,java]
----
registry.entityChange(Participant.class, Participant::getApplication).updated("status")
----

* `Participant.class` - the entity type being monitored for changes
* `Participant::getApplication` - function that converts the changed `Participant` to the target `Application`

.When to Use
* Monitoring entities connected through direct JPA relationships
* One-to-one or many-to-one relationships with getter methods
* Related entities share the same transaction context

===== Complex Repository-Based Mapping

**Problem:** Your checker needs to monitor entities where the relationship requires repository lookup to resolve the target entity.

For example, monitoring `SignableDocument` changes but needing to operate on the associated `Participant` through a complex relationship.

**Solution:**

[source,java]
----
registry.entityChange(SignableDocument.class, d -> participantRepository.getReferenceById(d.getOwnerId()))
    .updated("status")
----

* `SignableDocument.class` - the entity type being monitored
* `d -> participantRepository.getReferenceById(d.getOwnerId())` - repository-based mapping function

.When to Use
* Complex relationships not modeled as direct JPA associations
* Cross-context entity lookups
* Dynamic relationship resolution based on entity state

[NOTE]
====
**Performance Consideration**: Repository-based mapping introduces additional database queries. Use this approach only when direct relationship mapping is not possible.

== Checker Implementation Examples

=== BorrowerStartTreeChecker

The `BorrowerStartTreeChecker` manages borrower workflow initiation when participants complete required documentation.

.Checker Overview
[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
|Component |Description

|**Target Entity**
|`Participant` - The entity this checker operates on

|**Purpose**
|Automatically start decision tree process when borrower completes all requirements

|**Triggers**
|Document signatures and uploads for required participant documents

|**Business Logic**
|Update participant status to `IN_PROCESS` and start automated decision tree
|===

==== Listener 1: Application Form Signature Monitor

Monitors when application forms are signed and triggers workflow initiation.

**Purpose:** Track completion of application form signatures +
**Trigger:** `SignableDocument.status` changes to `SIGNED` for application forms +
**Target Resolution:** Maps document changes to owning participant

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/participant/checker/BorrowerStartTreeChecker.java[tags=signature-listener]
----

==== Listener 2: Required Document Upload Monitor

Tracks when required documents are uploaded to the system.

**Purpose:** Monitor completion of required document uploads +
**Trigger:** New `EntityDocument` insertions for required document types +
**Target Resolution:** Maps document uploads to owning participant

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/participant/checker/BorrowerStartTreeChecker.java[tags=document-listener]
----

==== Availability Check

Determines when the checker should execute its business logic.

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/participant/checker/BorrowerStartTreeChecker.java[tags=availability]
----

.Availability Conditions
* Participant must be a `BORROWER`
* Participant status must be `NEW`
* Application form must be signed
* All required documents must be uploaded

==== Business Logic

Updates participant status and initiates the decision tree process.

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/participant/checker/BorrowerStartTreeChecker.java[tags=perform]
----

.Business Operations
1. **Status Update**: Change participant status from `NEW` to `IN_PROCESS`
2. **Process Initiation**: Start the automated decision tree workflow
3. **Transaction Safety**: Both operations occur within the same transaction
