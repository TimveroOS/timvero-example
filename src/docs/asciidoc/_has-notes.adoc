= HasNotes Integration

The `HasNotes` interface allows any entity to have associated notes and comments through automatic integration with `ViewableFilterController`.

== How It Works

If your entity already has a dedicated view page with `ViewableFilterController`, you can add Notes functionality by simply implementing the `HasNotes` interface - the Notes UI will appear automatically.

The integration happens in three layers:

1. **Entity Level** - Add `HasNotes` interface to existing entity
2. **Controller Level** - Already extends `ViewableFilterController` (no changes needed)
3. **Template Level** - Framework automatically enables Notes UI on the view page

== Setup

Simply add `HasNotes` interface to your entity:

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Application extends AbstractAuditable implements HasNotes {
    // Your entity fields...
}
----

Your controller should already extend `ViewableFilterController` - no additional code needed for Notes functionality.

== What Happens Automatically

When `ViewableFilterController` detects that your entity implements `HasNotes`:

1. **Sets** `notesEnabled = true` in template model
2. **Provides** JavaScript integration for note operations

== Features You Get

* Notes section appears in entity views automatically
* Rich text note creation and editing
* Pin notes
* User attribution and timestamps
* Audit trail integration

No additional configuration required - the framework handles everything through the `ViewableFilterController` integration pattern.
