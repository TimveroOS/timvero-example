= Platform Overview

Build lending applications fast with pre-built components.

== What You Get

* **Forms** — Collect customer data with built-in validation
* **Database** — Automatic setup for loan data
* **Payments** — Connect to banks and card processors
* **UI Components** — Works on desktop and mobile
* **Business Rules** — Automate loan decisions

## What You Build

[.unstyled]
* 🎯 **Your loan products** (personal loans, mortgages, etc.)
* 🎯 **Your approval rules** (credit scores, income requirements, etc.)
* 🎯 **Your customer experience** (application flow, portal design, etc.)

== Three Parts

### 🏗️ Basic - Foundation
Forms, database, templates, documents  
*Used by everything*

### 📝 Origination - New Loans  
Applications, customers, approvals  
*Getting loans started*

### 💰 Servicing - Active Loans
Payments, interest, account management  
*Day-to-day loan operations*

== How It Works

```
Basic (foundation) → Origination (new loans) → Servicing (active loans)
```

**Example:** Personal loan process

1. Customer applies → forms, documents *(Basic + Origination)*
2. Loan approved → credit check, terms *(Origination)*  
3. Loan created → account setup *(Origination → Servicing)*
4. Customer pays → balance updates *(Servicing + Basic)*

== Key Platform Features

The platform provides several key features that make building lending applications easier:

=== 1. Consistent Patterns

Everything follows the same pattern, so once you learn one part, you understand the whole platform:

* **Entities** - Store your business data (customers, loans, payments)
* **Forms** - Collect information from users with built-in validation
* **Controllers** - Handle user actions like creating or editing records
* **Templates** - Display information to users in web pages

**Example:** Whether you're working with customers, loan applications, or payments, they all follow the same pattern.

=== 2. Automatic Business Rules

The platform can automatically handle business logic for you:

* When a loan application is approved → automatically create the loan account
* When a payment is received → automatically update the loan balance
* When a payment is late → automatically calculate late fees
* When a loan is paid off → automatically close the account

**Example:** You define the rule "charge a $25 late fee if payment is 10 days late" and the platform handles it automatically.

=== 3. Complete Audit Trail

Everything is tracked automatically for compliance and troubleshooting:

* Who made each change and when
* What the data looked like before and after changes
* Why each change happened (payment received, fee charged, etc.)
* Complete history of every loan account

**Example:** You can see that on March 15th, John Smith made a $500 payment, which reduced his loan balance from $5,000 to $4,500.

== What You Need to Know

To get started with the platform, you need to understand a few key concepts:

=== 1. Everything Builds on Basic

No matter what you're building, you'll always use Basic components:

* Every application needs forms to collect data
* Every application needs a database to store information  
* Every application needs templates to show information to users

**Start here:** Learn the Basic components first, then move to Origination or Servicing.

=== 2. Choose Your Focus

Decide what type of application you're building:

**Building a loan application system?** → Focus on Origination

* Customer registration and applications
* Credit scoring and risk assessment
* Loan approval workflows

**Building a loan management system?** → Focus on Servicing

* Payment processing and account management
* Interest calculations and late fees
* Customer account portals

**Building both?** → Start with Origination, then add Servicing

=== 3. The Platform Does the Hard Work

You don't need to build everything from scratch:

* Database setup is automatic
* Form validation is built-in
* Payment processing is pre-built
* Interest calculations are handled for you
* Audit trails are automatic

**Focus on:** Your business rules, your loan products, and your customer experience.

== Next Steps

Now that you understand the platform basics:

1. **Start with Getting Started** - Set up your first application and see how it works
2. **Learn the Basic Components** - Master forms, database, and templates (you'll use these everywhere)
3. **Pick your focus:**
   - **For loan applications:** Learn about customers, applications, and risk assessment
   - **For loan management:** Learn about credits, payments, and operations
4. **Build your application** - Start simple and add features as you learn

The platform handles the complex technical details so you can focus on your business logic and customer experience.
