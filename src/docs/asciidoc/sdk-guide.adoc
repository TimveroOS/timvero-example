== Why TimveroOS?

Building financial applications traditionally means months of development for basic features like payment processing, KYC compliance, and risk management. TimveroOS changes this by providing production-ready financial components that you customize through code, not configuration.

=== The Problem
* **6-12 months** to build basic lending platform from scratch
* **Complex integrations** with payment gateways, KYC providers, credit bureaus
* **Regulatory compliance** requirements that slow development
* **Scalability challenges** as your business grows

=== The TimveroOS Solution
* **2-4 weeks** to customize and deploy with pre-built components
* **Built-in integrations** for payments, documents, notifications
* **Compliance frameworks** for KYC, AML, reporting built-in
* **Enterprise-scale architecture** from day one

=== What You'll Build
This SDK empowers developers to create financial applications through:
* **Entity-Form-Controller Pattern** - Define business objects with automatic CRUD operations
* **Comprehensive Form System** - Handle complex forms with validation, nested components, and MapStruct mapping
* **Credit Operations Framework** - Manage loan lifecycle with automated calculations, accruals, and payments
* **Payment Transaction System** - Process real-world payments through multiple gateways with complete audit trails
* **Entity Checkers** - Implement event-driven business rules that respond to data changes automatically

For a complete working example, see the https://github.com/TimveroOS/timvero-example[timvero-example project^].
