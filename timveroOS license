Copyright (c) 2025 TIMVERO LTD. All rights reserved.

This repository contains a proprietary example project that is a functional subset of timveroOS (see timveroOS documentation at https://documentation.timvero.com/#credit-management-system). The code and associated files in this repository (collectively, the “Software”) demonstrate certain capabilities of timveroOS. All use of this Software is governed by the following terms. By accessing or using the Software in any manner, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to these terms:
	1.	License Requirement: All use of the Software (including evaluation, development, internal testing, and production) is strictly subject to a separate, valid software license agreement signed with TIMVERO LTD. If you do not have a current, signed license agreement with TIMVERO LTD that explicitly authorizes your use of the Software, you are not authorized to use, copy, modify, or distribute the Software, in whole or in part.
	2.	Proprietary Rights and Restrictions: The Software is proprietary to TIMVERO LTD and is protected by international copyright and other intellectual property laws. TIMVERO LTD retains all rights, title, and interest in and to the Software. Downloading, using, copying, modifying, or distributing the Software without a valid written license agreement from TIMVERO LTD is strictly prohibited and constitutes a violation of TIMVERO LTD’s proprietary rights.
	3.	No Open Source or Sublicensing: This Software is not provided under an open source license. Except as expressly permitted by a written agreement with TIMVERO LTD, no rights are granted for you to release the Software (or any portion of it) under any open source, freeware, or similar licensing terms. You may not sublicense, transfer, or assign the Software or any of your rights to the Software to any third party. You also may not incorporate the Software into any open source project or otherwise use the Software in any manner that would subject it to the terms of an open source license.
	4.	Intellectual Property Ownership: Using the Software under a license does not grant you any ownership interest in the Software. TIMVERO LTD shall retain exclusive ownership of all intellectual property rights in and to the Software, including any modifications, enhancements, or derivative works of the Software that you create. Any such modifications or derivative works are considered part of the Software and are owned by TIMVERO LTD. You agree to cooperate with TIMVERO LTD (at its expense) to secure TIMVERO LTD’s rights in any such modifications or derivative works, including by executing any documents necessary to assign those rights to TIMVERO LTD.
	5.	Contact for License: If you wish to obtain a license to use, evaluate, develop, or deploy this Software, you must contact TIMVERO LTD at contact@timvero.com. No rights to use the Software (beyond merely viewing the repository on GitHub) are granted until you have entered into a separate written license agreement with TIMVERO LTD.
	6.	Disclaimer of Warranty: The Software is provided “AS IS”, without warranty of any kind. TIMVERO LTD disclaims all warranties and conditions, express or implied, relating to the Software, including but not limited to any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. No oral or written information or advice given by TIMVERO LTD or its agents shall create any warranty. You assume all risks associated with the use of the Software, including but not limited to the risks of errors, damage to equipment, loss of data, or other issues.
	7.	Limitation of Liability: To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will TIMVERO LTD or its affiliates, officers, employees, agents, or licensors be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages arising out of or related to the Software or the use or inability to use the Software, including but not limited to damages for loss of profits, loss of data, business interruption, or any other commercial damages or losses, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. In no event shall TIMVERO LTD’s total cumulative liability for any claims arising out of or relating to the Software exceed the amount (if any) you paid TIMVERO LTD for the Software or USD $100, whichever is greater. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages, so some of the above limitations may not apply to you.
	8.	Audit Rights: If you have entered into a license agreement with TIMVERO LTD for the Software, TIMVERO LTD (or its authorized representative) may, upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours, audit your use of the Software to ensure compliance with the terms of that agreement and this License. You agree to cooperate fully with any such audit and provide access to all records and systems reasonably necessary for the audit. If an audit reveals any use of the Software beyond what is permitted by your license agreement, you agree to pay any underpaid license fees and the reasonable costs of the audit, and to immediately cease the unpermitted use of the Software. TIMVERO LTD reserves all rights to enforce its intellectual property rights and contractual rights in case of any unauthorized use.
	9.	Termination: Any use of the Software by you that is not in accordance with these terms (or with the terms of a separate written license agreement with TIMVERO LTD) is not permitted and will result in an immediate termination of any rights you may have to use the Software. If you do not have a valid license and you have downloaded or otherwise obtained the Software, you must immediately delete and cease all use of the Software. TIMVERO LTD reserves the right to take legal action against any unauthorized use of the Software to protect its rights.
	10.	Governing Law and Jurisdiction: This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the applicable jurisdiction of TIMVERO LTD’s principal place of business (without regard to its conflict of law principles). Any disputes arising under or in connection with this License or the Software shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in that jurisdiction, and you consent to such jurisdiction and venue.
	11.	No Waiver; Reservation of Rights: No failure or delay by TIMVERO LTD in exercising any right or remedy under this License shall operate as a waiver of such or any other right or remedy. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remainder of this License shall remain in full force. All rights and licenses not expressly granted in this License are reserved by TIMVERO LTD.
